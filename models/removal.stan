/* Where I left off:
  -------------------
  Trying to figure out how to index by species, then by sampling event (or sample
  event X time band). Basically, I want to grab all counts belonging to species
  x, which is easy enough because the original data are ordered by species, so
  it is just a matter of using the segment() function for each species. But where
  I am having a brain fart is that there are j_i time bands per sample event i,
  where length of j_i are not all equal. Anyway, this is tomorrow, or Monday's 
  issue.
